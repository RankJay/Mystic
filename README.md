# Mystic
>Mystic though still under-construction, in its beta release will be transformed into a website based on `Python` Back-end architecture connected with `JavaScript` front-end designed on Adobe XD as well as an ordinary JavaScript Compiler with an exclusive access to Pandit Deendayal Petroleum University students for their academic as well as non-academic programming practices and interested candidates based on their relativistic and working module ideas that might take this project a step-forward will be allowed to contribute to this project.

- Mystic is an open-source project designed to help developers instantly get most optimized code for their respective intended input and output with additionally providing them with 4 diffrent coding language export namely `C`,`C++`,`Python` and `Java`.
- Originally, it was designed to provide user with most accurate math function with respect to user provided input-output and programming language they wanted the respective program in.
- Since then, Mystic has been expanded single handedly in string operations like string appending as well as concatination and deleting of a string and also in data structures operations like array sorting, linked-lists and search trees as well as graph operations.
## Input-Output Based Operations
This section scans the input and checks whether the data received is any prgramming language code or not, if not it further asks user to enter desired output and respective language they want this program in.
The MasterControl then sends this data to Module.py which takes further steps to forward the data entries to respective intended language writer and its function generator to process out the procedure of writing code.
- [Module.py](https://github.com/RankJay/Mystic/blob/master/Module.py) is basically, the core-processor of the entire Input-Output Based Operations functionalities. The only module that reads the received input-output decides which operations should be executed and accordingly forwards the data to generate respective funtion and then further forward it to respective language `moduleWriter` class to write down the entire code and provide user with processed code in desired language intended by user.
- Functionality Distributor:
  1) Mathematical Functionality
  2) String-related Functionality
  3) Data Structures Functionality
### Mathimatical Funtionality
The underlying architecture of this entire module lies in interpreting and generating the mathematical function based on input-output that is provided by user. By following certain set of protocols as input, user can easily get the desired mathematical function.
1) Basic Arithmetic Opserations: Addition, Substraction, Multiplication and Division
2) Power raise to N
3) Nth Root
4) Logarithm to the Base N
5) Floor function
6) Ceiling function
7) Sine function
8) Cosine function
9) Tangent function
10) Sine-Hyperbolic function
11) Cosine-Hyperbolic function
12) Tangent-Hyperbolic function
13) Inverse Sine-Hyperbolic function
14) Inverse Cosine-Hyperbolic function
15) Inverse Tangent-Hyperbolic function
16) Absolute Value Function
### String-related Funtionality
The underlying architecture of this entire module lies in interpreting and generating the function related to string and file handling like concatination as well as changing cases and handleing any grammatical error based on input-output that is provided by user. By following certain set of protocols as input, user can be easily provided with the most significant algorithm based on output generated.
### Data Structures Funtionality
The underlying architecture of this entire module lies in interpreting and generating the source data structure based on input-output that is provided by user. By following certain set of protocols as input, user can be easily provided with the most significant algorithm for required data structure based on expected output. Here, the size of input matters, since asymptotic notations like Big-Oh is taken into consideration for evaluating certain parameters to generate expected outcomes.
1) Sorting Algorithm based on input array size
